# Autism Detection using an Ensemble Model

This project was created by me for my final year Minor Project. 

Over here we use a variety of models on a dataset, that I obtained from kaggle and then using CTGAN generated around 8000 more rows just for experimentation.

These models are:
  1. SVM
  2. Random Forest
  3. Naive Bayes
  4. KNN
  5. Logistic Regression
  6. XGBoost
  7. Decision Trees
  8. Ensemble Model of SVM and RF

The purpose of this project was to just apply these models onto the dataset to be able to predict autsim in individuals.

Along with the model there is a gui made using tkinter that will allow the user to interact with the model.
These interactions include:
  1. Answering the questions in the data to predict if the user has autism.
  2. Get some help if they want to know more about autism.
  3. Add their data anonymously to the dataset that will then be used to train the model.

To run this project yourself, you will require the libraries used in the jupyter notebook (Sorry I do not want to go inside and recheck which ones are there or not there.
Run the notebook first to obtain your model, which will be called 'ensemble_model.pkl' and then run the GUI.
